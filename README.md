# Neural_Net-for-Concrete-Crack-Detection
Building a neural network using Crack detection dataset created by SDNET2018. 
This project has been done as a part of my academics this include a basic implementation of deep learning for contactless concrete crack detection.
Reference to building a neural network for me is Udemy course on building self driving car and the starter bundle of Adrian Rosebrock-Deep learning for computer vision book. The necessary libraries are:
1) Numpy.      
2) OpenCV.     
3) scikit-learn.     
4) Tensorflow OR Keras.

The content in the file Wall_crack_detection_NN.ipynb was executed in google colab, hence significant changes need to be done for other platforms or for using local systems.
